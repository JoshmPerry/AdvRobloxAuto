Adv. RobloxAuto is the full loop back to RobloxAuto and maked the end of my highschool senior summer. A full year after predecessor, Adv. RobloxAuto outshines it in every way. Not only does it decrease game automization development time from 5 hours to 5 minutes, but it can also utilize threads meaning if statements can be running in the background as opposed to creating a hierarchy of possible game states.

Adv. RobloxAuto not only marked a firm understanding of Java classes, threads, and hierarchy, but it marked the end of my obsession with Java. Now that my classes started to teach Python and eventually C++, my attention has turned from Java. Even in this new beginning of unknown syntax and a bizarre lack of parenthesis, the lessons in software design that I've learned have always stayed with me.
